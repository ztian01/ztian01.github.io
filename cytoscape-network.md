# Tools - Cytoscape
**Language:** Python <br>
**Softwares / packages:** KGMLCanvas, Cytoscape <br>
ChBE194 Data Science in Biotechnology (2019 spring) Problem Set 4. <br>
Write a function that produces a KGML canvas image of a pathway with compounds and genes color coded based on significance.<br><br>
Light green - down regulated, not significant<br>
Dark Green ¨C down regulated, significant<br>
Pink ¨C upregulated, not significant<br>
Red ¨C upregulated, significant<br>

As an example output, show the figure for bile acid synthesis color-coded based on statistically significant proteins and metabolites from the rodent RYGB vs. SHAM dataset. <br>
Write a function that produces a cytoscape network and attributes file for a KEGG pathway with nodes color coded based on significance from the same rodent RYGB datset. Produce a network image for the bile acid synthesis pathway.<br>
